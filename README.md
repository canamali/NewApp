# Mobile Project Frontend Repo

## Background
At the moment, Mobile Project maintains a front-end web application (written with React.js) coupled with a server-side application (written with Django). The web ecosystem has evolved dramatically over the last decade, playing host to an ever-changing range of frameworks.
Expo is one of these powerful frameworks that enables the development of universal applications. Key features include:

* Usage of React Native
* Support for TypeScript
* Support for Android, iOS, and web
* Additionally, there are other benefits that Expo provides over native solutions, some of which are addressed in this document.
